#documentation notes
#This formula is taken from Mirwald et al, the following section (for boys)
# (Eq. 3) Maturity Offset=-9.236 +0.0002708*Leg Length and Sitting Height interaction -0.001663*Age and Leg Length interaction + 0.007216*Age and Sitting Height interaction + 0.02292*Weight by Height ratio
#where R = 0.94, R2 = 0.891, and SEE = 0.592.

#also note the Eq. 1 (seems very different, actually)
# Maturity Offset = -29.769 + 0.0003007Â·Leg Length and Sitting Height interaction -0.01177*Age and Leg Length interaction + 0.01639*Age and Sitting Height interaction +0.445*Leg by Height ratio,

#Also note this from the manuscript:
# The present results indicate that maturity offset can be estimated within an error of +/- 1 yr 95% of the time. We believe this level of accuracy is sufficient for adolescence to be assigned a maturational classification.

# age <- 15
# height <- 170.5
# weight <- 60.3
# sitting_height <- 82.3
#should give 0.2 (and it does)


#example 2 (from the above word doc)
# age<-12.084 
# height<-157.0
# weight<-53.0
# sitting_height<-79.6
#should give -1.4082 (and it does)
